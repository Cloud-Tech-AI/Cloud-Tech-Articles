**My Experience from being a Beginner to getting Azure Certified has been really great** . I was unaware about the Microsoft Azure as a Cloud Service but it truly is an amazing platform to learn Cloud Concepts and it’s Security related Concepts are one of the best in any Cloud Architecture . You need to Practice the Azure concepts and Understand the Architecture throughly in order to schedule and pass any Azure Exam .

**My Suggestion for any beginner** is to start with Understanding the Cloud Concepts then after Start Learning Path offered by Microsoft for Azure Exams . It takes time if you want to truly learn Azure Cloud Model and if you are interested in how Azure Cloud operates .
