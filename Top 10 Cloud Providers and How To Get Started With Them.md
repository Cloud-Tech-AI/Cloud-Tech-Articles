Cloud computing in 2020 is more mature, going multi-cloud, and likely to become more focused on vertical and a sales ground war as the leading vendors battle for market share.

My Background: I am Cloud and Big Data Enthusiast , I am here because I love to Talk about Cloud. I am 11x Cloud Certified Expert. 4x AWS Certified , 3x Oracle Cloud Certified , 3x Azure Certified 1x Alibaba Cloud Certified .
Picking the top cloud services provider isn’t easy given that the answer — much like enterprise software and IT in general — boils down to “it depends.”
Whether it’s
▫Microsoft Azure
▫Amazon Web Services (AWS)
▫Google Cloud
▫Alibaba Cloud
▫IBM Cloud
▫Oracle
▫Salesforce
▫SAP
▫Rackspace Cloud
▫VMWare

there are multiple variables for each enterprise.
The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/coronavirus-business-and-technology-in-a-pandemic/) and the [move to remote work](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/working-from-home-the-future-of-business-is-remote/) and [video conferencing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-video-conferencing-software-and-services-for-business/) are accelerating moves to the cloud. Enterprises increasingly are seeing the cloud as a digital transformation engine as well as a technology that improves business continuity. As work was forced to go remote due to stay-at-home orders tasks were largely done on cloud infrastructure. Collaboration tools such as [Microsoft Teams](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-master-remote-work-with-these-expert-tips/) and [Google Meet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-meet-goes-free-as-it-guns-for-zoom-aims-to-fend-off-microsoft-teams/) became cogs in the companies’ broader cloud ecosystem.
[Multi-cloud](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/managing-the-multicloud/) is both a selling point and an aspirational goal for enterprises. Companies are well aware of vendor lock-in and want to abstract their applications so they can be moved across clouds. The multi-cloud theme is being promoted among legacy vendors that have created platforms that can plug into multiple clouds — often with a heavy dose of VMware or Red Hat.
The game is about data acquisition. The more corporate data that resides in a cloud the more sticky the customer is to the vendor. It’s no secret that cloud computing vendors are pitching enterprises on using their platforms to house data for everything from analytics to personalized experiences.
Artificial intelligence, analytics, IoT, and edge computing will be differentiators among the top cloud service providers as will serverless and managed services. The market share grab has largely gone to AWS, which was early, adds services at a rapid clip, and is the go-to cloud service provider. AWS’ ability to upsell to AI, IoT, and analytics will be critical. Microsoft Azure is also looking to differentiate via AI and machine learning. Google Cloud Platform has gained ground due to its machine-learning know-how.
Sales tactics that play to fear, uncertainty, and doubt will be the norm. Toward the end of 2019 — not surprisingly right around AWS re:Invent — there appeared to be a mindshare battle in the press as the big three sniped at each other across multiple industries.

# Which is the best cloud?

As of July 2020, according to Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), AWS leads all the way as a leader in its ability to execute, but Microsoft’s Azure leads as a visionary. Google is third in the race followed by Oracle, Alibaba, and IBM.
**According to Me : Microsoft Azure and AWS** are necks to neck in the race of cloud supremacy. Both offer similar products, services, and costs. However, **Google**, IBM, and other clouds are getting better each day.

**If I were to choose a cloud provider for my business, it would have to be Azure or AWS.** The reason is obvious: both companies are way ahead in the race. You cannot go wrong with either of these.
If there are some specific tools and services offered by other clouds, you may end up deciding upon alternatives as well. For example, IBM Watson is a unique product used in IBM’s cloud service.

Most large enterprises use multiple clouds. One of the Famous Use-Case in the Industry is use AWS for file storage and messaging, Azure for DevOps, database and developer tools, and Google’s cloud for documents and emails.

One size doesn’t fit all. You figure out what your needs are, and which cloud fits you the best.
I hope that this guide helps you in building your career with Cloud and getting Cloud Certified,
