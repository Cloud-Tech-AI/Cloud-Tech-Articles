There are many out on the market today, but there are a few key tools that stand out amongst the crowd. There are many tools on the DevOps tools list, and each one has the potential to help your team perform. In order to determine what the best DevOps tools are, you may need to look through a few different tools before finding the right one.

DevOps tools are specific technical implementations of DevOps practices, helping teams to continuously improve their work in every facet of your development.

The integration of Development and Operations brings a new perspective to software development. If you're new to DevOps practices, or looking to improve your current processes, it can be a challenge to know which tool is best for your team.

Popular DevOps Tools

Puppet: Available as free open source and paid versions, this go-to automation tool automates critical manual tasks and simplifies tasks by abstracting critical configuration details across different OS and technology platforms

Docker: Beneficial for Dev environments, Docker allows quicker deployment and one can create own images or modify the existing ones as per the needs. A Docker-Puppet integration helps build robust images using more than seven million lines of Puppet code.
Terraform: An infrastructure provisioning tool that maintains the state of infrastructure using 'state files'. Facilitates public and private cloud infrastructure provisioning.

Vagrant: Tool for configuring virtual machines for a developer environment; Contains plugins that support cloud provisioning, cloud management tools and Docker

Docker: Works on the concept of process-level virtualization, Docker creates isolated environments for container appsConfiguration/Secret Management

Consul: An open source widely available tool mainly used for service discovery requirements; right fit to store and retrieve configurations in real time

Etcd: Another open source key value store used in Kubernetes to store the cluster operations and management state
Vault: An open source tool to store and retrieve confidential data that provides options to store secret key through encryptionDevOps 

Monitoring Tools

Prometheus & Alert Manager: Prometheus is a lightweight open source monitoring system built for modern application monitoring; supports Linux servers and container monitoring. Alert Manager takes care of mechanism for monitoring metrics

New Relic: A SaaS-based app that supports monitoring of Php, Ruby, Java, NodeJS, among other applications; gives insights about real-time performance of running apps

Sensu: Another open source monitoring tool developed for cloud environments; easily deployable through chef and puppet

Datadog: Another SaaS-based application and server monitoring solution that helps monitor docker containers and other related applications

Splunk: This is a powerful tool that has a significant role in monitoring and explore machine-generated data. Its specialty in indexing data of any type makes it unique among other DevOps tools besides its effective information-sharing mechanism.

Graphite: This tool is specialized in converting machine-generated data into graphical representations such as on-demand graphs. It renders chunks of available data into dashboards and graphs, which can further be deployed easily onto other applications or webpages.

Jenkins: One of the most popular DevOps tools known for supporting continuous delivery offering through DevOps. As a continuous integration server and a continuous delivery hub, Jenkins tool offers hundreds of plugins that can help in build, deploy and automate the project of any kind. As a Jenkins advancement, the new Blue Ocean sub-project came up with a better way of options to run, build and analyze project pipelines.

Git: This tool enables version control of software projects and is more familiar among Linux users. It has a special advantage when it comes to sharing of master versions of application files to distributed teams. But, Git by itself doesn't have a centralized repository.

GitHub: GitHub can be called as an extended feature to Git. Addressing the centralized repository gap in Git, GitHub appears as a solution for hosting Git repositories. Easing information sharing across teams through graphical representations, GitHub bridges key gaps between the teams making information exchange easier and effective. The public and private repositories are available in paid versions.

Gerrit: This is a web-based management solution for Git-run control system. Gerrit allows you manage code review and code repositories at a place. Gerrit is simply a web-based code review and repository management.

GoCD: Reliable and continuous integration form DevOps unique features, which means ensuring codes in short and reliable cycles. Here is where continuous integration plays a role and GoCD has a special place for that specific operation. This continuous integration tool offers complete visibility throughout the workflow. With Go, one can easily compare builds and go beyond that with dozens of easily-deployable plugins.

Mercurial: This is also similar to Git in its version-control feature. With an instant graphing tool, Mercurial is unique because of its distributed nature. Like Git, this tool has no dependence on a central repository.

Chef: A configuration-management tool for efficient web-scale IT operations. It uses the concept of 'recipes' for configuring databases, load balancing and web servers.

Ansible: Another powerful tool that offers the continuous delivery feature. With effective server and configuration management, this tool eases IT automation ending repetitive tasks and enabling faster deployments. Cloud provisioning, application deployment are among other key features of Ansible.

Kubernetes: This tool is a solution for age-old concerns related to server management, especially in updating and migrating servers. Kubernetes, an open-source tool, ensures a mechanism to deploy, maintain and gauge containerized applications. Limiting hardware resources usage, this tool offers application predictability.
