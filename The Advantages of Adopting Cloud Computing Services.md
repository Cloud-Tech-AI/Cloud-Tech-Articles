As recently as just a few years ago, business leaders worried about the unknown factors of moving their core applications to the cloud. Factors like not knowing how a particular application might work in the cloud were deterrents to what would have been optimal cloud migration, according to Tech Target. With new attention to performance metrics and understanding how their applications will scale with cloud services, organizations are finding cloud computing companies more attractive all the time.

**CMS Wire** confirms the rapidly increasing adoption of cloud computing services, reporting that enterprises are more willing than ever to stretch beyond the boundaries of their on-premises data center systems to invest in IT infrastructure that supports deployment in cloud environments. This large-scale migration to the cloud—cutting across various industries and a range of business sizes—is set to result in a projected **$266 billion annual spending on IT infrastructure and cloud services by 2021**.

# The Advantages of Adopting Cloud Computing Services

As you now seriously consider migrating your data and/or applications to one of the high-caliber cloud computing companies like Amazon Web Services, it may help you to learn just a few of the many ways your company can benefit from the advantages the cloud offers.

**Automated Application Deployments and Data Backups -**Managing the deployment of new code, security patches, data backup, and disaster recovery plans are crucial tasks for a software development company and should not be taken lightly. Even if your company is not a software development company, you still have to worry about security patches, data backup, and disaster recovery. Fortunately, these are all things that can be automated and managed more easily on the cloud. Cloud service providers like *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* provide the tools and automation necessary to make managing your deployments and data backups something you don't have to worry about.

**Reduce and Streamline IT Infrastructure Costs -**By adopting cloud services, you can say goodbye to the costly need to purchase servers that require expert installation, regular maintenance and full replacement every few years. You can also reduce the staffing costs you once spent to manage your detail-heavy infrastructure to focus your human resource allowance on tasks like tending to help desk issues and managing your system's internal controls.

**Continually Available Infrastructure -**The virtualized servers in cloud computing companies do not rely on specific hardware, so they are always available to your users via office computers, remote laptops or on mobile devices. Common hardware issues, such as hard-drive failures, no longer have any direct impact on your users' ability to access data and applications stored in the cloud.

**Flexible, Scalable, and Resilient Services -**Whether you own a small business and anticipate growth in the coming years, or you plan to further expand your large-scale operations geographically, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services offer the flexibility, scalability, and resilience that your enterprise requires. No matter what changes you have in mind for your organization, this trio of advantages means that you can grow your company without worrying about impacting your users' needs. You can add more storage space as needed while your users—across town or around the world—can access your database or applications with ease and without interruption.

**Trade capital expense for variable expense –**Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

**Benefit from massive economies of scale –**By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

**Stop guessing capacity –**Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

**Increase speed and agility –**In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

**Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers -**Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

**Go global in minutes –**Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

# Conclusion

Cloud computing continues to grow and will likely continue to do so. The **low-cost infrastructure** for enterprise solutions combined with the high-value services has resulted in cloud services being consistently in-demand.

The added cloud computing benefits like mobility and improvement to business insights all contribute to pushing cloud tech-forward.

Numbers from Statista prove why cloud computing is such a big deal:

The size of the cloud computing market has exceeded **$146 billion**
Global cloud data center traffic topped **10.6 zettabytes** in 2020
Demand for public cloud services is expected to grow more than 17 percent this year
Growth is expected among all types of cloud services, with businesses at all levels switching to **cloud-based tools** and storage.
